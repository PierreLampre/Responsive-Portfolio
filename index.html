            <p class="about-me-p">Hello and thank you for taking the time to peruse my online portfolio. Please feel
                free to move about the cabin.</p>
            <p class="about-me-p">For most of my life I have found joy in bringing joy to others through making things.
                I worked as a traveling singer and musician for nearly a decade, hoping to inspire people to dance,
                sing, and forget about there problems for a moment or two. As that career became less and less viable
                over the years, I found myself enamored by the endless possibilities that exist in the mind and
                fingertips of a web developer. It really is an exciting, never ending journey of learning and building
                an arsenal of skills. Thank you for reviewing my work and feel free to contact me with any feedback!</p>
