# Responsive-Portfolio

This is the second assignment given from Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.

Initially the class was asked to build a basic portfolio page with separate pages for and About Me section, a Portfolio grid, and a Contact form.  The next step was to make the site responsive, in order to look good on all devices.

I added media queries at 980px, 768px, 640px, and 500px.

Feel free to look over the code if you are working on a similar project!
